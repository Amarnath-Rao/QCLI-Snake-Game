# 🐍 Terminal Snake Game (Built with Amazon Q CLI)

A classic Snake game written in Python using the `curses` library, developed with the help of **Amazon Q CLI**.

## ✨ About the Project

This is a simple terminal-based Snake game built in Python. The logic and code were scaffolded and refined using **Amazon Q CLI**, an AI coding assistant that enhances productivity directly from your terminal.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Use **arrow keys** to control the snake.
- Eat the `*` (food) to grow longer.
- Don’t run into the walls or your own tail — or it's game over!

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
````

### 2. Run the game:

```bash
python3 game.py
```

> 💡 Make sure Python 3 is installed.

## 🐧 Platform Compatibility

* ✅ **Linux/macOS**: Works natively using the built-in `curses` module.
* ✅ **Windows**: Requires one extra step:

Install `windows-curses`:

```bash
pip install windows-curses
```

Then run:

```bash
python game.py
```

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Python 3**
* **curses library** (standard Python module for terminal graphics)
* **Amazon Q CLI** – Used to scaffold and assist with development.
